# JS 30 Day Challenge Projects (and others)

This repository is a collection of various mini-projects built as part of the **30 Day Challenge by Wes Bos**. Each project is designed to solve a specific problem or demonstrate a key JavaScript, CSS, and HTML concept.

### Key Features:

- A collection of small, focused projects.
- Projects tackle a wide range of frontend challenges.
- Clear navigation through the `index.html` menu.
- Practical examples of core JavaScript concepts.
